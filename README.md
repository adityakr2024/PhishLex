# Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine-learning model designed to detect phishing URLs based on various features extracted from the URL link. Phishing URLs are malicious links that are designed to deceive users into providing sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, or financial information. By accurately identifying phishing URLs, this model aims to enhance cybersecurity measures and protect users from potential online threats.
